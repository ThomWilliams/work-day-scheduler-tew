Assignment 5 - Thom Williams: Work Day Scheduler 

Completed task for week 5 of the University of Manchester Coding Bootcamp course.

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery, plus enhanced functionality and styling from third party API's Bootstrap, Moment date library, Google Fonts and Font Awesome. The UI has been designed with a clean, polished, and accessible interface designed for mobile and desktop.
